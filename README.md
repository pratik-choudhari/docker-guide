Docker is a tool that enables your applications to interact and run in containers(isolated wokspaces) with minimum execution requirements.
To understand what `minimum execution requirements` means conider the traditional apprpoach of using VMs, might result in wastage of resources such as memory, disk space and bandwidth consumption. 
Using only sufficient amount of resource which will provide us optimal output is the ultimate goal of containerization. 
Okay but why docker? Virtual machines were made for this sole purpose?
